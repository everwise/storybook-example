# Storybook Example - Pok√©dex
This is an example repo to demonstrate [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a UI development environment.
## Getting Started
First, clone the repo and navigate to the folder. In the CLI, run the following commands to get up and running:
```bash
nvm use 6 #create-react-app requires node version 6+
yarn
yarn storybook
```
Open your browser and go to `localhost:9000`. You should see the Storybook environment. You can play around with the components that already exist or write your own components using the data provided.

For the purposes of demonstrating Storybook, we're using [Boostrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) components.
